## Ethan - Canvas API Interface
The code in canvas_test.py reaches out to two endpoints: the current users courses, and the current users course assignments. These endpoints return the respective JSON data which is then consolidated into two lists of dictionaries. The first list is for courses, the second is for course assignments. This will serve as the foundation for further implementation where the retrieved information is used to populate the database used by the frontend. This was the expected behavior from the prompt. ChatGPT was used here due to the simplicity of the requirement, as writing queries for a well documented API is trivial for a model such as ChatGPT. As the implementation goes more in depth and is tailored to the application, there will be less usage of AI since it will becomes less dependable.
